						<p style="padding: 60px;"> Hello! My name is Marco Perez. I am currently a rising Junior studying Data Science in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at
							the University of Michigan. After taking my first computer science class my senior year of high school I was hooked. I love coding because I
							think of it as usable art. If I can think it, I can make it a reality with code. Starting with a blank page and ending with something useful
							is challenging and the sense of accomplishment cannot be beat! The whole process is addicting and fulfilling. Whatever I may do in the future, I want 
							to be able to make an impact in the tech industry. I not only want to put my Computer Science knowledge to use in order to advance programs, but I also
							want to inspire and motivate those around me.
						

						<div style="display: inline-block; padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
							When I'm not coding, I can be found touring the city on my bike, in the gym recording educational fitness videos or experimenting in the kitchen.
							After my parents bought me my first bike in 8th grade, a new love was born. Not only was the feeling of trekking outdoors on two wheels amazing but
							the bike itself caught my interest. To this date, I have built five bikes part-by-part from scratch. Biking used to be my only exercise regime until
							I got introduced to weightlifting my first year of high school baseball. What started as a required hour at the gym turned into an amazing addiction. I now run
							a fitness Instagram with 2500+ followers where I share my fitness tips and knowledge hoping to motivate my followers to get up and moving. My love for cooking 
							can be traced back to the best chef I know, my mom. From a young age, I was curious how someone could make food that was so delicious and my mom made sure
							to show me all her secrets. Now I spend too much time looking for new recipes to try out in the kitchen. If my food tastes half as good as my mom's then I have succeeded.
