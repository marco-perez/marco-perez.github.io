                            <p>Java syntax, expressions and statements, control flow, objects and types, inheritance, polymorphism,
                                    arrays, exceptions, interfaces, nested and local classes, generics, input and output, graphical
                                    user interfaces, threads, and mobile programming. </p>

							<h4 style="text-align: left;" >Project 1:Tweet Sentiments</h4>
							<p><img src="images/tweet.jpg" class="projectleft">First project is a very basic program that analyzes Twitter data to determine how people within a geographical region feel about a topic compared to people outside that region. I define basic data structures for locations and tweets, assign sentiments to a tweet based on the words it contains, and aggregate tweets according to location to determine the average sentiment within and outside a region. The purpose of this project is to gain some basic literacy of Java, involving both reading and writing Java code.</p>

							<h4 style="text-align: left; display:inline-block">Project 2:Tefball</h4>
							<p><img src="images/tefball.JPG" class="projectright" >For this project, I implement a game called TefBall. The game is similar to American football.
                             The game consists of multiple objects on the field, including a ball, and some number of players.
                             All players progress through the game via a function named performMove(). Different types of players act differently, so this project will utilize polymorphism to provide multiple implementations for a common interface. The primary focus of this project is the use of polymorphism but it is fairly involved so I got a lot of exposure to coding in java. I also made sure to thoroughly test my program.</p>

							<h4>Project 3: Wheel Of Fortune</h4>
							<p><img src="images/wheel.jpg" class="projectleft" >In this project I implemented a version of the popular game show “Wheel of Fortune” using a graphical user interface(GUI) written using Swing components in Java. The game is implemented as a Java application and uses user input to progress through the game. </p>
